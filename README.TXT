========================

JOCRConverter is a software that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for two powerful open source tools - ocrmypdf and Tesseract OCR. The software is designed to allow users to easily convert scanned documents or images into searchable and editable PDFs.

The ocrmypdf software is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 and is used for converting non-searchable PDFs into searchable ones. This tool employs various techniques to recognize and extract text from scanned documents, including optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning algorithms.

The Tesseract OCR tool, on the other hand, is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and is used for recognizing and extracting text from images. This tool is known for its accuracy and is widely used in the field of document analysis.

JOCRConverter combines the functionalities of these two powerful tools and provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to convert their documents into searchable and editable PDFs. The software is compatible with various image and PDF formats and can be used on multiple operating systems. With JOCRConverter, users can easily digitize their paper documents and make them searchable and editable, saving time and effort in the process.
